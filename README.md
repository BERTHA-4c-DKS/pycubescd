CD code and related cubes module

tomcompile it: python -m compileall pyCD.py 

pycd.py: Produce a CD curve using a single cube file

pybader.py: Used to evaluate the partial integral of an 
            integrand in cube format on a Bader's volume mapped 
            on cube.

pycdfrags.py: Produce a CD curve using three cubes the two fragments 
              and the total molecule

pycdexct.py: can be used for instance in the case of excited states 


pydt.py: Generalized the idea of the isodensity: spatial grid is assegned tyo fragment 1 or 2 
         depending on their relative density value. Density based descriptors for the CT and 
         polarization effects associated with the interaction between two fragments and the formation
         of the chemical bond are reported.
